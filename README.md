Student information system using cloud computing
=================================================
Serverless computing has emerged as a new compelling paradigm for the deployment of Applications and services .It represents an evolution of cloud programming models, abstractions, platforms and is a testament to the maturity and wide adoption of Cloud technologies.
Cloud Computing has been intended as the future-generation technology of an IT enterprise. It moves the application and the databases to vast data centers. So we have created a serverless web application that enables users to request access without servers. The application will present users with an HTML based user interface for getting information about the events that will conducted by different colleges where they would like to participate and gain knowledge on different technologies and IT Services . A Static Website to be hosted with User Management and a serverless backend is created.Â JavaScript executed in the browser sends and receives data from a public backend API built using Lambda and API Gateway. The data can be retrieved in a PDF or EXCEL format when the faculties needed.

Created a Web application for the students to know about the Events that are conducted in various colleges. An About page is accessed first which has the institutions in the navigation bar. The events can be viewed in respective college's page as the events may vary for different streams.A Events publish page is created to publish the events. This page is authenticated as everyone don't have the permission to publish. A Faculty Login Page is created to access the details on the students who have attended the events. Then can be able to generate the report of the students who have participated in the events.
