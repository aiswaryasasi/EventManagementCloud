Student information system using cloud computing
=================================================
Serverless computing has emerged as a new compelling paradigm for the deployment of Applications and services .It represents an evolution of cloud programming models, abstractions, platforms and is a testament to the maturity and wide adoption of Cloud technologies.
Cloud Computing has been intended as the future-generation technology of an IT enterprise. It moves the application and the databases to vast data centers. So we have created a serverless web application that enables users to request access without servers. The application will present users with an HTML based user interface for getting information about the events that will conducted by different colleges where they would like to participate and gain knowledge on different technologies and IT Services . A Static Website to be hosted with User Management and a serverless backend is created.Â JavaScript executed in the browser sends and receives data from a public backend API built using Lambda and API Gateway. The data can be retrieved in a PDF or EXCEL format when the faculties needed.

Module done: User Interface design
Created a Web application for the students to know about the Events that are conducted in various colleges. A webpage2.html page  is accessed first which has the details about the college and has the institutions in the navigation bar. The events can be viewed in respective college's page as the events may vary for different streams.A Events publish page is created to publish the events. This page is authenticated as everyone don't have the permission to publish. A Faculty Login Page is created to access the details on the students who have attended the events. Then can be able to generate the report of the students who have participated in the events.

Module done: Launch Web Server
Create a Virtual machine to launch a Web server. 
After creating a Remote Desktop we have to access the Web server from the Network Administrator.
At the topright we have a manage option click on it.
Now install the Web Server.
Now open the Internet Information Services.
We have a inetpub folder in which the root folder is accessed. 
The web application is hosted in that root folder.
Now for accessing the Webpage a url is generated.
Module Pending: Resource Termination

future enhncement:
          This project is focused on establishing the extracurricular activities for the students and in the future the students can apply OD through this web application  directly and also  the OD request  can be approved by the  faculty through this system. And the students can post their own innovations through this system.
          
percentage completed:We have completed almost 95% of our project.
